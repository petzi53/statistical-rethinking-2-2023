The following\ntext does not yet reflect these new callout boxes and the rules that now\napply. I have postponed to adapt the explications until I have more\nexperiences about their usefulness. I think this will be the case after\nI have finished to reformat the end of chapter 4 with the rules of the\nsecond draft.\n:::\n:::\n\n### Text Passages {.unnumbered}\n\nThis book collects personal notes during reading of Statistical\nRethinking by Richard McElreath. I am using the [second\nedition](https://www.routledge.com/Statistical-Rethinking-A-Bayesian-Course-with-Examples-in-R-and-STAN/McElreath/p/book/9780367139919)\npublished 2020 by [CRC Press](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRC_Press)\nan imprint of Routledge of the Taylor & Francis Group. Additionally I am\nusing [Statistical Rethinking\n2023](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDcUM9US4XdPz-KxHM4XHt7uUVGWWVSus),\nthe most recent set of free YouTube video lectures.\n\nYou can find links to other material on McElreath's [website about the\nbook](https://xcelab.net/rm/statistical-rethinking/). Of special\ninterest for me are the\n[brms+tidyverse](https://bookdown.org/content/4857/) and the\n[Stan+tidyverse](https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/rethinking2/)\nconversion of his code. As I am not very experienced with R and\ncompletely new to Bayesian statistics and their tools this additional\nmaterial is for me also very challenging. I am planning to read them\nsimultaneously (section by section) and will dedicate parallel sections\nfor their approaches. This has the advantage that the section numbers of\nthe files conform to the section numbers of the [second edition of the\nprinted\nbook](https://www.routledge.com/Statistical-Rethinking-A-Bayesian-Course-with-Examples-in-R-and-STAN/McElreath/p/book/9780367139919).\n\nSections with the\n\n-   header \"Original\" refers to the original book\n-   header \"Tidyverse\" refers to the {**tidyverse**} / {**brms**}\n    conversion\n-   header \"Stan\" refers to the {**rstan**} conversion\n-   header \"Reconsideration\" refers to sections with my personal\n    comments.\n\nMy text and code consists mostly of quotes from the - second book\nedition 2020 or - from the text of Robert McElreath's video lectures\n2023 or - from Solomon Kurz's tidyverse / brms version or - from Vincent\nArel-Bundock converted Stan code version.\n\nOften I made minor editing (e.g., shorting the text) or put the content\nin my own wording. But almost all of my text of this Quarto book are not\nmine, but is coming from the resources mentioned above. Therefore I had\nmany times not indicated these quotes. If you follow the book or the\nother resources you will note the similarities and know to which\nparagraph or section I am referring. And you will also realize whenever\nthe text passage reflects my own thoughts. In any case I am the only\nresponsible person for this text, especially if I have used code from\nthe resources wrongly or misunderstood a quoted text passage.\n\n::: callout-warning\n###### Warning\n\nI wrote this book as a text for others to read because that forces me to\nbe become explicit and explain all my learning outcomes more carefully.\nPlease keep in mind that this text is not written by an expert but by a\nlearner. In spite of replicating most of the content it may contain many\nmistakes. All these misapprehensions and errors are my responsibility.\n:::\n\n### Code Chunks {.unnumbered}\n\nPackages {**rethinking**} and {**brms**} have similar tasks. Therefore\nthey share a lot of identical function name. Kurz has unloaded the\n{**rethinking**} package when it came to explain {**brms**} function and\nto prevent name conflicts. But this approach is not efficient for the\nstructure of my documents where I have constantly changed between these\ntwo packages. So I just loaded with `base::library()` only the\n{**tidyverse**} meta packages with it attached nine packages:\n{**dplyr**}, {**forcats**}, {**ggplot2**}, {**lubridate**}, {**purrr**},\n{**readr**}, {**stringr**}, {**tibble**}, and {**tidyr**}.\n\nWhenever I used another packages I called the function with the package\nname in front with the syntax `<package name>::<function name>()`.\n\nTo prevent conflicts in chunk names, objects and variables I added the\nfollowing suffix to the end of the name:\n\n-   suffix `a` for the original book version in the main text\n-   suffix `b` for the {**tidyverse**} / {**brms**} version in the main\n    text\n-   suffix `c` for the {**rstan**} version in the main text (not used)\n-   suffix `ea`for the book version (R Base / {**rethinking**}) of the\n    exercises\n-   suffix `eb`for the {**tidyverse**} / {**brms**} version of the\n    exercises\n-   suffix `r` for the {**rethinking**} version in the synopsis\n-   suffix `s` for the Stan {**rstan**} version in the synopsis\n-   suffix `t` for the {**tidyverse**} / {**brms**} version in the\n    synopsis\n\nI am not using the exact code snippets for my replications because I am\nnot only replicating the code to see how it works but also to change the\nvalues of parameters to observe their influences. Especially when it\ncomes to plotting I try to use\n[ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/index.html) instead\nthe base plotting system I have no experience at all.\n\nAs I have already some experiences with the {**tidyverse**} approach I\ndo not include all code snippets from Kurz's version. I am concentrating\nto learn Bayesian statistics and if there are no conceptual news for me\nI am not going to include the corresponding passages.\n\nThis is my first book using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) instead of\n[bookdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/) I am using these notes\ntherefore also to learn Quarto. As a result you will find sometimes\nremarks or call-out blocks to my Quarto experiences.\n\n### Synopsis {.unnumbered}\n\nAt the end of each chapter I summarize the rationale for the used\ntechniques. It is more than a summary because it goes into details of\ncode chunks. But I will leave out all supporting or illustrating\npassages and focus on a holistic point of view. The code chunks are\nsomewhat cleaned so that the most important code snippets to understand\nthe technique are in the center.\n\nThis synopsis gives me another occasion to digest the main points and\ntry out the most important code chunks of the text. I will use the same\nnames for code chunks, objects and variables as in the main text but\nwith different suffixes (`r`, `s`, `t` instead of `a`, `b`, `c`).\n\n## Get Code Examples {.unnumbered}\n\nGo to the [book website](https://xcelab.net/rm/statistical-rethinking/)\nand download the [R code\nexamples](http://xcelab.net/rmpubs/sr2/code.txt) for the book.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndir.create(\"R\")\ndownload.file(\"http://xcelab.net/rmpubs/sr2/code.txt\", \"R/code.R\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n::: callout-caution\n###### Caution\n\nThere are big differences between the code snippets of the 2nd edition\ncollected in [code.txt](http://xcelab.net/rmpubs/sr2/code.txt) and the\nnew version preparing the 3rd book version. These new code snippets can\nbe found in the slides and/or in the videos. I will always refer to the\nplace where they can be found.\n\nAdditionally you will find all the scripts supporting the animation in\nthe lectures at the [new 2023 github\nrepo](https://github.com/rmcelreath/stat_rethinking_2023).\n:::\n\nThe style of the code snippets is not the [tidyverse\nstyle](https://style.tidyverse.org/index.html). For instance: The equal\nsign `=` is not embedded between spaces but a list of variables,\nseparated by comas has in front and before the coma a space.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsample <- c(\"W\",\"L\",\"W\",\"W\",\"W\",\"L\",\"W\",\"L\",\"W\")\nW <- sum(sample==\"W\") # number of W observed\nL <- sum(sample==\"L\") # number of L observed\np <- c(0,0.25,0.5,0.75,1) # proportions W\nways <- sapply( p , function(q) (q*4)^W * ((1-q)*4)^L )\nprob <- ways/sum(ways)\ncbind( p , ways , prob )\n```\n:::\n\n\nI have converted the original code style with the RStudio addin\n{**styler**} package to tidyverse style: Assuming that the default value\nof the style transformer is `styler::tidyverse_style()` I selected the\ncode snippet I wanted to convert and called the addin which ran\n`styler:::style_selection()`. As an example: The transformation of the\nabove code snippet resulted into the code below:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsample <- c(\"W\", \"L\", \"W\", \"W\", \"W\", \"L\", \"W\", \"L\", \"W\")\nW <- sum(sample == \"W\") # number of W observed\nL <- sum(sample == \"L\") # number of L observed\np <- c(0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1) # proportions W\nways <- sapply(p, function(q) (q * 4)^W * ((1 - q) * 4)^L)\nprob <- ways / sum(ways)\ncbind(p, ways, prob)\n```\n:::\n\n\nAs copy & paste from the slides does not work I downloaded the PDF of\nthe Speaker deck slides. But still, it didn't work always. In that case\nI used [TextSniper](https://textsniper.app/ \"App for text recognition\")\nand formatted manually. But these copy & paste problems only arise when\nusing new code, prepared for the 3rd edition. With the book (2nd ed.) I\ndo not have problems to copy the code snippets via calibre with the ePUB\neBook version.\n\n### Setup Chunks {.unnumbered}\n\nAt first I tried to collect all necessary package to load with\n`library()` in the `setup` chunk (See [Quarto equivalent to RMarkdown\nsetup\nchunk](https://community.rstudio.com/t/quarto-equivalent-to-rmarkdown-setup-chunk/153018)).\nThe idea was to be able to run individual calling functions from\ndifferent packages for test purposes and not to have to run all code\nchunks of the very long files. Additionally I tried to prevent conflicts\nof function names with the `conflicts_prefer()` function of the\n{**conflicted**} package in each setup file.\n\nBut it turned out that this was not a feasible approach: I noticed\nbetween packages with similar purpose (in my case between\n{**rethinking**} and {\\*\\*brms\\*}) too many conflicts. Furthermore many\nof these conflicts are hidden because the came from imports from other\npackages.\n\nI will therefore just load the meta package {**tidverse**} in the setup\nchunks of every files. To prevent conflict with function names I will\ncall functions of other packages with the syntax \\<package\nname\\>::\\<function()\\>. This has the additional advantage to learn from\nwhich package the function comes from. And my aim to be able to run code\nchunks separately is also possible.\n\nI will differentiate between \"base R\" referring to all packages loaded\nautomatically after starting R and the package {**base**} itself, that\nis part of the collection of \"base R\" packages.\n\nIf you find errors please do not hesitate to write issues or PRs on my\n[GitHub site](https://github.com/petzi53/statistical-rethinking-2-2023).\nI really appreciate it to learn from more experienced R users! It\nshortens the learning paths of self-directed learners.\n\n## Package Installation {.unnumbered}\n\nIn contrast to the sparse and partly outdated remarks in the book use\nthe installation section from the `rethinking` [package at\nGitHub](https://github.com/rmcelreath/rethinking#installation \"Installation of 'rethinking' package\").\n\n### Step 1 {.unnumbered}\n\nFrom the three steps I had already successfully installed the first one\n(`rstan` and the `C++` toolchain), so I had no need to follow the\ndetailed instructions of the `rstan` installation at\n<https://mc-stan.org/users/interfaces/rstan.html>.\n\n### Step 2 {.unnumbered}\n\nTo install the `cmdstanr` package I visited\n<https://mc-stan.org/cmdstanr/>. This is an addition to my previous\ninstallation with the older version (2nd ed., 2022). As I installed the\nlatest beta version of `cmdstanr` the first time I also needed to\ncompile the libraries with `cmdstanr::install_cmdstan()`.\n\nTo check the result of my installation I ran\n`check_cmdstan_toolchain()`.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ninstall.packages(\"cmdstanr\", repos = c(\"https://mc-stan.org/r-packages/\", getOption(\"repos\")))\ncmdstanr::install_cmdstan()\ncmdstanr::check_cmdstan_toolchain()\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe command for downloaded `cmdstanr` did not install the vignettes,\nwhich take a long time to build, but they are always available online at\n<https://mc-stan.org/cmdstanr/articles/>.\n\nThe vignette [Getting started with\nCmdStanR](https://mc-stan.org/cmdstanr/articles/cmdstanr.html) also\nrecommend to load the `bayesplot` and `posterior` packages, which are\nused later in the `CmdStanR`-examples. But I believe these two packages\nare not necessary if you just plan to stick with the book.\n\n### Step 3 {.unnumbered}\n\nOnce the infrastructure is installed one can install the packages used\nby the book. With the exception of rethinking --- the companion package\nof the book -- they can all be downloaded from CRAN.\n\nI had already devtools installed, therefore I deleted it from the list\nof installed packages.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ninstall.packages(c(\"coda\",\"mvtnorm\", \"loo\",\"dagitty\",\"shape\"))\ndevtools::install_github(\"rmcelreath/rethinking\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Course
